    <h1>About me</h1>
    <a href="./index.html"><h2>Home</h2></a>
    
    <p>I used to be an Asian chef back in the day. I was also the kinda guy cooking at home and experimenting in the kitchen. Funny enough, now I don't cook at all... That was a year ago, now I order food almost daily..
    </p>

    <p>But I didn't want my old recipes to just sit forgotten, so I decided to share them here on this website. They might not come with the smell of a real kitchen anymore, but at least they come with stories, memories, and a taste of the past.</p>

    <p>If you noticed, I said I was an Asian cook, but the recipes you'll find here go far beyond just one country. And that's exactly what I love about food:</p>

    <p>Some people take it to extremes, arguing about which country has the “best” cuisine. But when you sit at a table with people of different backgrounds, cultures, or skin colors, the food reminds us of something simple: before the food, we are all the same.</p>

    <p>(no pineapple on pizza tho)</p>
