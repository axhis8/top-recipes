      <p>
        Schnitzel is a traditional Austrian (Viennese) dish consisting of thin
        veal cutlets. <em>Crispy, airy, and juicy</em> thanks to a breading
        process. But in some places, this type of meat is rarely found, so I
        created this chicken schnitzel recipe.
      </p>
      <p>
        This recipe should be pretty simple compared to the
        <a href="./shawarma.html">Shawarma</a> recipe, as it doesn't require
        many ingredients and it is not like the
        <a href="./pizza-napoletana.html">Pizza</a> recipe, because it also
        doesn't require much time.
      </p>
      <p>
        So as I said, it's not only very tasty, but also very quick and easy to
        make. Here's what you need:

        <h3>STEPS</h3>
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Prepare the breading station (dredging line):</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>One plate with flour</li>
            <li>One plate with <strong>lightly</strong> beaten eggs</li>
            <li>One plate with breadcrumbs (Panko)</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is very important that you beat the eggs lightly, else it
              wouldn't stick to the meat.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Prepare the meat:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Butterfly the fillets and season both sides</li>
            <li>Place plastic wrap over the meat on a cutting board</li>
            <li>
              Pound flat with a meat mallet, rolling pin, plate, or even a pot
              is possible.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Bread the schnitzel:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Coat the meat in flour, shake off excess</li>
            <li>Dip in egg (make sure it's evenly covered)</li>
            <li>
              Place in breadcrumbs (Panko),
              <strong>but do NOT press down</strong>. As this keeps the coating
              light and airy for that authentic, crispy crust.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Fry the schnitzel:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat enough oil or clarified butter in a pan so the schnitzel can
              “swim”
            </li>
            <li>
              Use high heat to start, then reduce to medium-high once the
              schnitzel is in
            </li>
            <li>
              Move the pan continuously in a circle motion while frying to keep
              the coating from sticking and to help it puff up
            </li>
            <li>Only when the first side is golden and airy, flip carefully</li>
            <li>If using oil, add a small knob of butter for flavor</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Its important to note that if you do not have a big pan, don't
              throw the whole chicken in it, as it may get saucy because of the
              yoghurt. Either sear it separately, which I recommend or add less
              chicken first and then slowly more.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Serve:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Once golden and crispy on both sides, remove and place on paper
              towels briefly
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve immediately with fries, potato salad, or sauce of your
              choice
            </li>
            <li>Best with lemon.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
