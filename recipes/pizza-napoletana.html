    <!-------------------- DESCRIPTION -------------------->
    <p>The traditional pizza, in my opinion the best. Very simple, yet so delicious. Very easy to make, but it feels so rewarding when you eat it. That's why it was worth including in my TOP recipe. The process may take time, because it is important to let the dough rest. The upside: an airy dough. Thus, eating a pizza is like eating a cloud.</p>
    <p>Personally, I don't like making food where you need to wait overnight, so I recommend making multiple doughs, freezing them, and using them over the next few months. You can look that up on Google. Now, let's get to the recipe.</p>
    <p>This recipe has a dough of 70% hydration, ensuring a airy, easy to digest pizza. If the dough is hard to deal, you can use less water, for example like 60%. But it wont be as light and tasty as the latter. With the following ingredients, you can make up to 6 Pizzas. A scale is very much recommended for the ingredients.</p>
    
    <!-------------------- INGREDIENTS -------------------->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <h4>DOUGH</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg All purpose flour</li>
        <ul><li>aim the ones with 13gm protein, the more the better - so the dough doesn't break easily when you work with it</li></ul>
        <li>700ml cold water</li>
        <li>30g salt</li>
        <li>3g fresh yeast</li>
        <li>100g sugar</li>
        <ul><li>Why sugar you may ask. It's important as it gives the color and a beautiful crust, as we won't work with a stone pizza oven. If you have one which goes up to 400Â°C, than you might skip this ingredient.</li></ul>
        <li>5g salt per 400g tomato sauce</li>
        <li>basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <h4>SAUCE</h4>
    <p>For the authentic sauce:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>San Marzano peeled tomatoes <strong>without citrus</strong></li>
        <ul><li>if it is too expensive or not available in your local grocery, than any peeled tomatoes <strong>without citrus</strong> should do the job.</li></ul>
    </ul>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <h4>TOPPINGS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>San Marzano peeled tomatoes <strong>without citrus</strong></li>
