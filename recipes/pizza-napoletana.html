    <div class="card description">
      <p>
        The traditional pizza, in my opinion the best. Very simple, yet so
        delicious. Very easy to make, but it feels so rewarding when you eat it.
        That's why it was worth including in my TOP recipe. The process may take
        time, because it is important to let the dough rest. The upside: an airy
        dough. Thus, eating a pizza is like eating a cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I don't like making food where you need to wait overnight,
        so I recommend making multiple doughs, freezing them, and using them
        over the next few months. You can look that up on Google. Now, let's get
        to the recipe.
      </p>
      <p>
        This recipe has a dough of 70% hydration, ensuring a airy, easy to
        digest pizza. If the dough is hard to deal, you can use less water, for
        example like 60%. But it wont be as light and tasty as the latter. With
        the following ingredients, you can make up to 6 Pizzas. A scale is very
        much recommended for the ingredients.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      </div>
      <h4>DOUGH</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1kg all purpose flour
          <ul>
            <li>
              aim the ones with 13g protein, the more the better - so the dough
              doesn't break easily when you work with it
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>700ml cold water</li>
        <li>30g salt</li>
        <li>3g fresh yeast</li>
        <li>
          100g sugar
          <ul>
            <li>
              Why sugar you may ask. It's important as it gives the color and a
              beautiful crust, as we won't work with a stone pizza oven. If you
              have one which goes up to 400Â°C, than you might skip this
              ingredient.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>5g salt per 400g tomato sauce</li>
        <li>basil leaves</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>SAUCE</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          San Marzano peeled tomatoes <strong>without citrus</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              if it is too expensive or not available in your local grocery,
              then any canned peeled tomatoes
              <strong>without citrus</strong> should do the job.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>TOPPINGS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>3 packs mozzarella (fresh are better than the dried ones)</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>Basil leaves</li>
        <li>
          If you wish to add more, like tuna or onions feel free to do so
          (<strong>except</strong>
          for pineapple).

    <div class="card recipe">
      <div class="food_title">
        <h3>STEPS</h3>
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li><h4>Preparing the dough:</h4></li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, combine flour, water (reserve about 100ml), yeast
            and sugar
          </li>
          <li>Knead for 5 - 10 minutes until it looks crumbly</li>
          <li>Add salt and the remaining water</li>
          <li>Cover the bowl with a cloth and let it rest for 15 minutes</li>
          <li>
            Fold the dough from the sides <em>(do not knead)</em> and let it
            rest for another 15 minutes covered - so the dough keeps air inside
            and creates tension
          </li>
          <li>
            Fold again; once the dough has a better shape, transfer it to the
            table from the bowl and continue folding gently there
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover the dough with the bowl downside again and let it rest for 15
            minutes
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat folding until the dough becomes smoother. Brush a little
            olive oil on the dough and in the bowl so it wont stick over night
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the dough in a container (preferably small) and let it rest in
            the refrigerator for 24 hours (minimum 8 hours, maximum 48 hours)
            covered.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <li><h4>Making the sauce:</h4></li>
        <ol>
          <li>Put a can (should be about 400g) in a Bowl</li>
          <li>Add 5g of salt</li>
          <li>
            Now get your gloves ready and smash those tomatoes. Why not a
            blender? Blending may destroy the tomato seeds, thus making the
            sauce more bitter
          </li>
          <li>
            Slap some basil leaves (literally, they deserve some spanking) - as
            it results more aroma
          </li>
          <li>Mix and leave it in the fridge covered for the next day.</li>
        </ol>

        <li><h4>Preparing the toppings:</h4></li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Mozzarella should be prepared the day before. As stated it's better
            to use fresh ones than the dried one as they are overall tastier.
            But putting them directly on the pizza might be to watery
          </li>
          <li>So we cut them into strips</li>
          <li>Put it in a sieve over a bowl</li>
          <li>
            Then let them rest over night, so the liquid may drip on the bowl,
            thus still being fresh but also not to watery.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <li><h4>The dough the day after:</h4></li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Take the container and flip it upside down opened over the table so
            the dough falls smoothly on it - shake if needed
          </li>
          <li>admire its size</li>
          <li>
            Divide the dough into portions of 280g (with a scale) for Neapolitan
            pizzas. One small portion will remain; you can use it to make a mini
            pizza or homemade brea.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place each portion in a small container or all portions in a big
            container and let them rest for at least 2 hours, covered with a
            cloth
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to its maximum temperature (convection) at least 30
            minutes before the 2 hours are up
          </li>
          <li>
            After 2 hours, sprinkle flour or preferably semolina on the dough
            portions to prevent sticking
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle flour or preferably semolina on the work surface, place a
            dough portion on it, and gently stretch and shape it (do not press
            too hard, use fingertips carefully, go toward the edge but not
            completely through). You want to keep the air inside the dough
          </li>
          <li>Flip many times and keep shaping the dough in a round form.</li>
        </ol>

        <li><h4>Baking:</h4></li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Remove the tray from the oven <em>(be careful, it's hot!)</em>.
            Quickly place the pizza on parchment paper, then put the paper with
            the pizza om it carefully on the tray
          </li>
          <li>Spread tomato sauce on the pizza and slide it into the oven</li>
          <li>
            Bake for 4 - 8 minutes (depending on the oven) until the dough is
            firm and the sauce is not burnt
          </li>
          <li>
            Add toppings: first Parmesan, then basil, and finally Mozzarella at
            the <strong>end</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return the pizza to the oven for 2 - 6 minutes (depending on the
            oven)
          </li>
          <li>
            Be careful that the mozzarella wont burn and keep an eye on the
            pizza
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove, slice, and enjoy! Repeat the process for the remaining
            pizzas. A good pizza can be pulled away with the hands
