## About this Project

These are my own recipes from past experiences and experiments. I made them a year ago and I didn't want them to go to waste: So I decided to post them here. Feel free to suggest some improvements or if you found some bugs. I hope those recipes are going to be worth it to make!

This project is a task from The Odin Project, a structured full stack development course. You can learn at your own pace and it starts from 0 to getting employed. I highly recommend taking this course.

## About me

I used to be an Asian chef back in the day. I was also the kinda guy cooking at home and experimenting in the kitchen. Funny enough, now I don't cook at all... That was a year ago, now I order food almost daily..

But I didn't want my old recipes to just sit forgotten, so I decided to share them here on this website. They might not come with the smell of a real kitchen anymore, but at least they come with stories, memories, and a taste of the past.

If you noticed, I said I was an Asian cook, but the recipes you'll find here go far beyond just one country. And that's exactly what I love about food:

Some people take it to extremes, arguing about which country has the “best” cuisine. But when you sit at a table with people of different backgrounds, cultures, or skin colors, the food reminds us of something simple: before the food, we are all the same.

### Assignment

**Iteration 1: initial structure**

1. Within the odin-recipes directory, create an index.html file.
2. Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.

**Iteration 2: recipe page**

1. Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.
2. Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example lasagna.html. You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration, you can find a recipe to use at Allrecipes. Be sure to include the usual boilerplate HTML. This boilerplate code should be in every .html file you create.
3. For now, just include an h1 heading with the recipe’s name as its content.
4. Back in the index.html file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. The text of the link should again be the recipe name.
5. Add a link back to the index page on your recipe page for easier navigation. You can place this link at the top or bottom of your recipe page (e.g., lasagna.html).

**Iteration 3: recipe page content**
Your new recipe page should have the following content:

1. A free image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier.

2. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.

3. Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.

4. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.

**Iteration 4: add more recipes**

1. Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
2. Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.

**Iteration 5: add design**
(different course later on)

Remember the Recipe page you created as practice from the HTML Foundations section? Well, it’s rather plain looking, isn’t it? Let’s fix that by adding some CSS to it!

- How you actually style it is completely open, but you should use the external CSS method (for this practice and moving forward). You should also try to use several of the properties mentioned in the previous lesson (color, background color, typography properties, etc). Take some time to play around with the various properties to get a feel for what they do. For now, don’t worry at all about making it look good. This is just to practice and get used to writing CSS, not to make something to show off on your resume.
- We haven’t covered how to use a custom font for the font-family property yet, so for now take a look at CSS Fonts for a list of generic font families to use, and CSS Web Safe Fonts for a list of fonts that are web safe. Web safe means that these are fonts that are installed on basically every computer or device (but be sure to still include a generic font family as a fallback).
