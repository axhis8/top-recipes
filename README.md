## About this Project

These are my own recipes from past experiences and experiments. I made them a year ago and I didn't want them to go to waste: So I decided to post them here. Feel free to suggest some improvements or if you found some bugs. I hope those recipes are going to be worth it to make!

This project is a task from The Odin Project, a structured full stack development course. You can learn at your own pace and it starts from 0 to getting employed. I highly recommend taking this course.

## About me

I used to be an Asian chef back in the day. I was also the kinda guy cooking at home and experimenting in the kitchen. Funny enough, now I don't cook at all... That was a year ago, now I order food almost daily..

But I didn't want my old recipes to just sit forgotten, so I decided to share them here on this website. They might not come with the smell of a real kitchen anymore, but at least they come with stories, memories, and a taste of the past.

If you noticed, I said I was an Asian cook, but the recipes you'll find here go far beyond just one country. And that's exactly what I love about food:

Some people take it to extremes, arguing about which country has the “best” cuisine. But when you sit at a table with people of different backgrounds, cultures, or skin colors, the food reminds us of something simple: before the food, we are all the same.
